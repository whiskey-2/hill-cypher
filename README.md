This is an encryption method that uses matrices, taught in Calc 1ZC3.
This script takes any sentence, and any matrix of your choice and encrypts the message.
It can also decrypt messages if you have the encrypting matrix.
It can also decrypt the message if you have the numbers corresponding to only a few letters.
